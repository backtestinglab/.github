> We've all been there!
>
> Staring at the chart, another loss. Another red day, week, month, or year. A blown account. A failed prop firm challenge. You breath in... and release a frustrated sigh. That one bad trade you were so sure about, only erased weeks of your hard-earned progress. The frustration slowly builds up until you decide to "quit" (which never actually happens) or you lose control of your emotions and have the urge to smash EVERYTHING in sight.

> Does this sound like a profitable trader to you? 
>
> Probably someone trading mostly on hope and luck, which is NOT a long-term winning strategy!
>
> But it doesn't have to be that way.

> The truth? Hope isn't an edge. Luck isn't a system. You're fighting algorithms, hedge funds, professionals and skilled institutional traders. If you're not upping your game, you'll be their exit liquidity. It's time to stop guessing and start trading like a professional.

  <strong>Stop trading blind. Start trading with a data-driven model you built, tested, and trust.</strong>

### **Why BacktestingLab?**

We're building the tool we always wanted! One that respects your strategy, your data, and your intelligence.

-   üîí **Privacy First, Always.** You are in full control. Your strategies and historical data **never leave your machine**. We only collect minimal, anonymous usage stats (e.g. last active date) to know if people are actively using the software. That's it!
-   üîì **Open Source Frontend.** The entire user interface is open source. Fork it, learn from it, contribute to it. We believe in transparency. Savvy developers can even build their own custom backend to interface with our UI.
-   ü§ù **Combined Manual & Automated Backtesting.** Our software is designed for the discretionary trader. Use our powerful tools to quickly and automatically find your potential setups (your "base case"), then step through each one manually to apply your unique discretion and refine your edge.
-   üìä **Visualize Your Edge.** Stop relying on messy spreadsheets or numbers from backend only software. We provide the tools to intuitively build, refine, fine-tune and analyze your trading models. See your top model's performance, understand its stats, and build unshakable confidence in your trading system.
-   üéØ **Trader-Centric.** Built for manual traders, including styles like ICT and classical price action. This is **not** a tool for high-frequency quant trading, complex mathematical arbitrage, or options greeks.

### **Key Features (In Development)**

*   **Bring Your Own Data (BYOD):** Securely import your `.csv` or `.json` OHLCV data. We process it locally into a high-performance format.
*   **Intelligent Resampling:** Upload 1-minute data, and we'll automatically generate all higher timeframes for you.
*   **Advanced Charting & Drawing Tools:** A professional-grade charting experience to visualize and annotate your setups.
*   **Structured Model Development:** A guided workflow to take you from a raw idea ("Studies/Research" or "Develop") to a well-refined, battle-tested system ("Refine" & "Fine-Tune").
*   **In-Depth Analytics:** Understand your model's win rate, profit factor, average trade time, and much more.

### **Get Involved & Early Access**

This is a passion project, built by a trader for traders. We're on a mission to help manual traders finally find and prove their edge in the market.

We will be launching a **paid Early Access Program** for a limited number of serious traders.

-   **What you get:** The latest builds of the software, direct access to the founder for onboarding and support, and the power to prioritize new feature requests.
-   **The deal:** This will be a **one-time fee**. No monthly recurring BS fees. You buy the software, you own it. This will greatly help to fund continued development.

**If you're a dedicated trader serious about building a real edge and want to be part of this from the ground up, I want to hear from you.**
